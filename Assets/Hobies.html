<h1>Hobbies</h1>
<p>Welcome to my world of serious leisure.<br />
Here are a few of my favorite pastimes when I’m not being fabulous full-time:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Bird Watching (from a safe indoor distance while chirping furiously)</li>
    <li>Sunbeam Napping – Ideally from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., with minimal interruptions</li>
    <li>Box Sitting – If it fits, I sits. Size doesn't matter.</li>
    <li>Zoomies – Midnight track meets across the living room</li>
    <li>Tail Chasing – Still convinced it’s not mine</li>
    <li>Stealth Mode – Disappearing mysteriously right before vet appointments</li>
    <li>TV Critic – Especially nature documentaries with squirrels or fish</li>
    <li>Furniture Acrobatics – Leaping from couch to curtain like a majestic orange ninja</li>
</ul>
<p>If it's weird, dramatic, or involves snacks — I’m probably into it.</p>
